# What's Naamio?

Naamio is supposed to be my own AI chat app. ChatGPT free limits are getting more and more painful and I want to utilize AI more for various stuff.

However, I'm not fully satisfied with any current solution. I'm a programmer though - so why not build my own 😄 That's exactly what Naamio is going to be. Focused on my own needs and my own way of approaching AI. Heavily opinionated and probably not meant to be used by a lot of people.

That's also supposed to be a bit of a proving grounds, before starting to build other, bigger apps that I want to build, but I have a creative block a bit.
